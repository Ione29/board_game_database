# board_game_database

For the "Introduction to Web Programming" course, I created a site where users can add their board games.
Features:
log in via username + password combination
adding owned board games to your user profile
keeping track of the board games the user wishes to get in the future
comparing your collections to other users of the site
MariaDB was used for the database, connecting it to the front-end with PHP and JavaScript.
